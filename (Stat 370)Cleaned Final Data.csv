I don't feel like I'm any different from them, so I'm always left wondering if maybe I hadn't noticed how people think of the color of my skin rather than the person itself. I've been told by many people that I've been surrounded by that as a person in my time at Winona, I am a phenomenal person to be around since I'm always keeping things lowkey and fresh and entertaining because that's just who I am. But when I hear some of my friends who also happen to be black talk about their experiences, I genuinely get a bit shocked seeing how their experiences differ from my own since a lot of the people that I greatly consider friends or trusting have done and said some things that didn't sit well with them, or make an unfair misjudgment on that person's character. I don't think that either side is terrible people, and I honestly don't want to think poorly of people that I spent most of my college life with and want the people I love and care about to be able to get along. It may be a pipe dream, but I genuinely think it's possible with the wide variety of people I've met, and interacted with whether it would be online or offline. But you can't please or cater to everyone sadly, and sometimes, some people genuinely shouldn't interact with each other, there are certainly a few individuals that I legit hate that maybe someone might be friends with, but I'm not going to try and force them to just not associate with them unless I have a valid reason to give. But that's just how I feel about all of this in general, my experiences are much different from those who share the same skin color that I do which leads to things that I may not have thought about since I've been treated differently in comparison to them and I just want to be able to have us all get along and understand each other."

For one of my required social work courses, the class was required to watch an Asian American documentary and write a reflection about it on a discussion post. One of the classmates wrote a very racist post. Containing the ideas that Asian Americans are dog eaters, they have to put on a white face to get along, and overall very depressing. I was enraged, I believed that the student should have been expelled that they would be kicked out of the social work program, but as the professor shared the racist student, only dealt with minor consequences, such as a public apology to the class, and to watch white privilege videos, and the professor emphasized that this should be a learning outcome. I strongly feel that if it were any other student, they would have a dealt with harsher punishment. After two weeks of discussing the racism of the classmate, the professor concluded that we should all move on, which, also made me very upset and I sent an email to the racist student, and professor stating

‚Äú I found that your post was very disturbing and is extremely disrespectful towards all Asian Americans. I have not been able come to terms with what was done but I hope that you will be educated in anti-racism and grow from generalizing/ stereotyping minority groups. I strongly feel that your harmful post whether unintentionally or not, came from a place of arrogance, animosity and/or bias. As one of the few students of color in class, I now find it difficult to feel safe in the educational setting that we all as a class share. To add, as someone who holds position of power, I expect that you will be using your privilege for the better good in the nearby future and will continue to practice ethical behavior. Lastly, I am intrigued as your apology may not be sincere due to the assumption that you used artificial intelligence to generate your message‚Äù 

I‚Äôve even approach professor in person, and all, she said to me was that I have a powerful voice, and I should continue to voice my concerns. If this is true, I feel that the situation shouldn‚Äôt have been just swept under the rug. I strongly feel that the social work faculty is letting the racist students get away with racism, simply because the student is white. I have contributed my emotions via email and in person, but as a first generation person of color my voice has gone nowhere."

For example, when I have eaten lunch by Zane's in the student union, I see the separation of students of color and white students. I am not saying that they should be eating together, but that I noticed that students of color eat alone for what I have seen. I have eaten with some of the students of color who were sitting by themself, most who were international students, that have expressed that they have also felt the same way that I have. They have confided in me that a reason they have chosen WSU is due to its affordability for a college education. I feel that many of their experiences are similar to mine in that it is lonely being a student of color here and how dominant cliques are that make it difficult to find community here but also how subtle discrimination is prevalent at WSU. While I do understand that at some points and instances I would have to eat alone or be alone, I do not think that it should be almost always that I see it. I haven't had a conversation with any person at WSU that I was not acquainted with, such as being in the same program, or introduced to that I did not do myself. Referring this back to cliques at WSU, I find that any person would find it difficult and no doubt a person of color would find it even more difficult as there are few students of color that I even see on campus. 


An example about what I have experienced while at WSU is my job that I have at WSU right now. I am the only person color in my department and the only male-identifying person in the department as well. My other coworkers and supervisor are white women. I am not saying that it is bad because they are white women, I am simply stating the demographics of who I am working with and how my interactions have been ""different"" in my perspective. When I first started my job, my supervisor said a microaggression towards me that I remember very clearly. She said ""Since you speak good English, I don't think you should have any problem with responding to emails."" It came off as ignorant as I have been raised in the States my whole life and can speak English clearly without any noticeable impairments. Other instances that I have noticed are when I am invited to group meetings in my department, where I feel like there's a clear difference in the environment. I understand that this is part of the white professionalism that I am experiencing, but also how I am only invited when there is a need for me to be there. I work in a group that involves 3 other staff and for my work, but I have rarely attended these meetings as I believe that I am not required to be there even though I am on the team. I understand that I may be a graduate student, but I am still a staff on this campus as well which has given me different vibes while working here. Another instance where I have felt a weird vibe while working with this department is when my supervisor invited my to have lunch with the team at a local restaurant. I went with them and there was 5 of us total. I noticed that they were unconformable with my presence as they are usually talkative and engaging with each other while they work in the office. It may have been an off day for them or something else, but that is what I noticed when I was present with them. It may be a Midwestern thing or a culture thing in the States, but I feel that there's a definite circle that I have experienced that isn't necessary harmful but somewhat exclusive to what I have gone through. I am able to talk with the staff fine when it is just me and another staff member, but I can't find the right words to describe what it is like in a group setting with them. I will say that my supervisor is making efforts to be inclusive of me in at work and is trying to support me in with any questions or concerns. 

I believe that most of the discrimination that I have experienced at WSU are more related to isolation and microaggressions that have contributed to affecting my mental health."
